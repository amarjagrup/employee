# employee

        This is a console based application using C#. The purpose of this application is to store employee information in a database. 
        This program will ask a user to enter in 5 options. Those options are to insert a user, delete a user, 
        update a user, show all users or quit the program. This program stores all user input in a MySql database.
        The database will store the first and last name and the job title that was entered. Each record
        will also have a unique id associated with it because two people can work in the same job title
        and have the same name, so there would need to be a way to identify each user. I am also assuming the
        user will enter a valid name and a valid job title. This ia all done through the console. To use this program you will need to
        configure your database connection.
